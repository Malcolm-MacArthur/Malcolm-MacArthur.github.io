    <h2 class="content__topic">Summary</h2>
    <p class="content__text">
        I have created a large Python3 stock analysis program over the summer of 2018. It scrapes and processes data
        of over 6000 US stock tickers from multiple websites, and it stores the data in a SQLite3 database. After given
        some calculation settings, it generates a score for every stock and displays it along with other information in
        a table to determine which stock fits the userâ€™s needs. The scraping use multithreading and multiprocessing for
        maximum efficiency, and I use PyQt5 to implement a UI. If the program were ever to get popular, I fear it would
        be blocked by one of the sites being scraped, so the program repository is not publicly available. However, it
        is available upon request.</p>

    <h2 class="content__topic"> Collection</h2>
    <p class="content__text">
        Before any analysis can be done, data must be collected. The user first navigates to the page displayed below by clicking
        the "collect" tab at the top right. It is also worth noting that when starting the program this page is displayed first.
    </p>

    <p class="content__text">
        The user must press the "collect" button to start. This action switches the collect tab screen(displayed below)
        and starts the scraping process.
    </p>
    <img class="content__image" src="Pictures/Researcher/collecting_page.png">
    <p class="content__text">
        The scraping process first downloads and parses a csv file from the official NASDAQ website which contains a list
        of all public US stock tickers. Then it starts scraping the individual Yahoo Finance ticker pages. The ticker
        page collection process will take about 2 hours due to the limiter I placed on the scraping process. Furthermore,
        for every Yahoo Finance ticker finished, it calls an API for the price history of the ticker in order to calculate the ticker's rsi.
        This entire process is multithreaded to increase and/or maintain the speed. The process can be cancelled any time,
        if the user presses the "stop" button. The multithreaded process can be stopped because I implemented a kill signal
        that all threads and the thread creator listens for. All successes and errors are displayed on the log. Once the
        process is done or has been killed, the user can press "finish" to go back to the original screen.

    <h2 class="content__topic">Analyses</h2>
    <p class="content__text">
        If at least one days worth of ticker data stored in the SQLite tables, then analysis can be done. It should also
        be worth noting that analysis can be done will the scraping process is active. The user must press the "Analyze"
        at the top right to get bunch of options shown below.
    </p>
    <img class="content__image" src="Pictures/Researcher/options_page.png">
    <p class="content__text">
        With "Get measures from" you can select any day stored in the database to analyze. The "Stock performance on"
        can be used to see the percent gain/loss the stock has achieved past the "Get measures from date". The "Analyze"
        section gives the user a chance to analyze a certain sub group of tickers. Lastly the "Measure Strengths" section
        gives the user the power to select which measure will have the most impact on score. The down arrow means the lower
        the value the better and the up arrow is the opposite. These arrows can bw switched by clicking them. The numbers
        beside the arrows is the percent strength of the measure. The measures should sum to a 100% but it is not required.
        <br>
        After the user has selected the options, the "Analyze" button is pressed. This brings up a new a bigger window
        shown below.
    </p>

    <p class="content__text">
        There are two tables shown. The top table shows the minor statistics of the group of tickers which are mean, Q1,
        median and Q3. The bottom table shows the rankings of each ticker and there respective measure rankings. Each cell
        has a number contained within curly braces which shows the rank of the stock's measure compared with the other stocks'.
        The number beside the rank number is the actual value of the measure for the specific stock. For each stock a score
        is produced with the ranking and strength of each measure. With this score the user can determine which stock to buy.
