This is my personal website which displays everything on my resume and more.
There are three sections "Home", "Projects" and "Skills & experience". The 
"home" section gives an overview about myself. The "Projects" section shows 
the nonclassroom public/private related projects I have done. These projects can
be selected from the projects dropdown or from the projects screen. Each project 
page has detailed information about that comes along with pictures. Lastly the 
"Skills & experience" section shows my work experience and technical skills I 
have.
